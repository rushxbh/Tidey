# Tidey

## About This Project

**Tidey** is a blockchain-powered, gamified platform for beach conservation. It transforms beach cleanup initiatives through technology-driven engagement and transparent impact tracking, serving as a central hub that connects environmental volunteers, NGOs, and coastal communities. Tidey coordinates large-scale cleanup efforts and addresses the fragmentation in current sustainability initiatives.



## Our Approach
Tidey provides a unified ecosystem where volunteers can discover nearby events, track their personal environmental contributions, and receive blockchain-verified recognition as proof of environment and impact. The platform combines real-time beach health monitoring with intelligent volunteer matching algorithms, ensuring optimal resource allocation and maximum environmental impact.
